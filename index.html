            <p class="intro-text">
                In the present age, known as Kaliyuga, the spiritual state of the soul (*jeevatma*) is described as
                piteous:
                "Slackened mind, intellect and thought processes. Consistently surrounded by problems. Adhi (natural
                disasters), Vyadhi (illness) and Upadhi (social propriety that come with name and fame) eating away
                one's mental peace. Sunk in bad association. Easily influenced by Maya. Constantly harassed by material
                desires." All these describe the state of the jeevatma in this Kaliyuga. If someone is still able to
                persevere in the bhakti sadhana of Radha Krishna then it is only due to mercy of Guru and rise of
                samskaras of previous lives. Harinaam is the best and the primary way of bhakti sadhana, all other
                forms of bhakti are secondary to Harinaam.
            </p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <p>"Harer naam harer naam harer naamaiva kevalam,<br> kalau nasteyiva nasteyiva nasteyiva gatiranyatha."
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Meaning: Harinam is the only, only and only way to acquire bhakti. In kaliyuga, there is no, no, just no
                other way. (The purpose of saying thrice is to emphasize on its importance).
                Even without any sacrifice or abstinence from pleasures, Harinaam is able to pull the mind from material
                pleasures and direct one's inclination towards bhakti of Radha Krishna.

            <p class="intro-text">
                God has innumerable names. They have been described in various Puranas and Smritis. Krishna, Mukunda,
                Murari, Govind, Ram, Narayan and so on. The *Shrimad Bhagavatam* provides guidance on which name to
                chant:

                Meaning: "'Sapriyanaam' means the name which is dear to you. The name of God which you like, are
                passionate
                to chant, and which attracts your heart, should be chanted repeatedly. (It can be different for
                different people)". By chanting the name repeatedly, Harinaam prabhu will cleanse your mind of
                materialistic
                inclination and purify your mind.

            <p class="intro-text">
                The Hare Krishna Mahamantra is called the Maha-Mantra, the king of all mantras, because it contains all
                divine potencies. It is not just a naam (holy name); it is a mantra. A mantra has specific, invested
                powers (shakti). Some mantras bestow knowledge, some bestow power. The Harinam Mahamantra is a
                *prema-prakashak* ‚Äî it is the bestower of Prema, or pure, divine love for the divine couple.

                    beings as the indwelling Supersoul.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Mahaprabhu made this mantra simple. There are no rules of time, place, or purity. You can chant while
                rising, sitting, eating, or sleeping. He invested all divine potencies into it. This is the king of
                mantras, the Maha Mantra, because there is no mantra above it. The fruit of other mantras may be
                liberation, but the fruit of Harinam is Prema‚Äîpure, divine love for Radha and Krishna, which is the
                highest attainment.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Any seeker from any spiritual path (sampradaya) who takes shelter of the Harinam Mahamantra will very
                quickly achieve their own spiritual goal (ishta-siddhi), because the Name will bestow its grace upon
                them. Many great ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß-‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æs (perfected saints) have chanted the Harinam Mahamantra. My own Gurudev
                attained perfection after Radharani Herself appeared and bestowed grace upon him at Prem Sarovar, yet he
                continued to chant the Harinam Mahamantra. If you look at the last 500 years, you will see that 70-80%
                of the saints mentioned in the Bhaktamal (stories of devotees) achieved perfection through the Hare
                Krishna Mahamantra.

                Potency of Radha Naam</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">
                If someone has not been able to find his Guru yet, and has no affiliation with any Acharya parampara,
                therefore, is he not able to progress in sadhana and receive mercy of Krishna? The *Padmapuran* has
                answered that "among all the names of Bhagwan, Radha naam is the superior most name". By chanting Radha
                naam, all sins wash away and Krishna himself tries to please and shower mercy on the sadhak. For a
                fallen soul victimized by the negative traits of Kaliyuga, the best path is to take shelter of Srimati
                Radharani and Radha naam, and pray to her:
            </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
                <p>"He Radharani, He Karunamayi, I take the shelter of your lotus feet. I am yours. Please save me!

                    have mercy on me! Please protect me!"</p>
            </div>
            <p class="intro-text">
                To chant the Radha naam, there is no need for a guru, place, time, purity, or impurity. The one who has
                more attachment to Radha naam than Shri Krishna's name, that person is called a Radhanishtha devotee. By
                the grace of Radha naam, one day the sadhak will attain a guru, and then by guru's grace, they will
                attain the loving service of the divine couple Shri Radha Krishna.

            <p class="intro-text">
                For those who have found their Gurus, following their respective paths prescribed by their Gurus is the
                best path for them.

            <p class="intro-text">
                Harinam can be chanted (japa) in three ways: Vagyas japa, Manas japa and Upanshu japa. Each mode is
                suited for different environments, times of day, and levels of concentration, allowing the practitioner
                to remain absorbed in chanting under any circumstance.

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>This is Harinaam sankirtan or chanting loudly. In this form, Harinaam benefits both the
                            speaker/singer and the listener. When there is a lot of commotion, for example if you are in
                            the middle of a party, you cannot concentrate on harinaam without chanting it loudly. It is
                            considered highly beneficial as it purifies not only the speaker but also any person or
                            living entity who hears the sacred sound. This mode is ideal for congregational chanting
                            (<em>sankirtan</em>), public chanting processions, or when one is in a private space where
                            loud chanting is possible without causing disturbance. It is also useful for concentration
                            in
                            noisy environments.</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>This mode involves moving the lips to form the syllables of the mantra, but so softly and
                            quietly that only the chanter can hear it. This is practiced in a place where there is a lot
                            of sound and one could neither do kirtan nor contemplate Harinaam, like in a marketplace.
                            This
                            method is exceptionally practical for chanting in public places, such as a marketplace, on
                            public transport, or in any environment where loud chanting would be inappropriate or where
                            maintaining mental focus amidst external noise is challenging.</p>

                        <p>This is chanting in one's mind, neither the lips will move nor there is any sound of
                            Harinaam.
                            Harinam will play like a recorded tape on loop inside the mind. But for this, we need total
                            silence and a lot of concentration. The best time for Manas japa is when everyone is asleep
                            at night and there is no sound anywhere. If someone asks whether we must contemplate on
                            pastimes of Krishna while chanting, the answer is while doing Manas japa, one must
                            concentrate on Harinaam only. If you contemplate on pastimes of Krishna, you will not focus
                            on Harinaam and Harinaam will be given less importance. One must become engrossed in
                            Harinaam
                            while chanting and leave behind all other thoughts. This form of Harinaam sadhana is very
                            powerful. But one must lessen one's need to sleep to sit in Padmasana and do Manas japa at
                            night. One has to take satvik food and almost no dinner at night to stay awake. Or, one can
                            sleep early and wake up at 1am to do Manas japa. (Baba says Shri Ram Vairagi Baba, who is a
                            disciple of Shri Deoraha Baba and is 100 years old, still wakes up at 1pm at night daily and
                            practices Manas japa. He sometimes comes over to Baba's ashram to stay for a few weeks.)</p>
                        <p>A sadhak should have full focus on Harinaam, it doesn't matter he is able to do any lila
                            chintan or not. When Harinaam prabhu will shower mercy the pastimes of Krishna will emerge
                            in the heart of sadhak on their own. Take the shelter of Harinaam, Naam ashray.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">
                The ultimate effectiveness and spiritual potency of chanting are determined not by the quantity of
                mantras recited, but by the quality of consciousness with which the chanting is performed. There is a
                profound distinction between pure chanting and its reflection.

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>This is a stage of chanting where the mind, despite one's best intentions, wanders to various
                            worldly thoughts, anxieties, and desires‚Äîwork, family, future plans, past regrets‚Äîwhile the
                            lips and tongue mechanically repeat the mantra simply to complete a prescribed number of
                            rounds. If your mind is wandering to various thoughts, to Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, etc. and
                            also chanting to complete the number of rounds you are supposed to finish then it is called
                            Namabhas. It will not go futile but it will take a long time to achieve the fruits of
                            chanting harinaam.</p>
                        <p>However, practicing Namabhas it slowly purifies one's heart and slowly the sadhak is able to
                            beget the full mercy of harinaam. Then slowly he starts experiencing the pastimes of Radha
                            Krishna as if he is present there. Slowly he is able to comprehend his actual form, that is
                            the Manjari Swarupa. And serves Radha Krishna in that swarupa. So it is not that practicing
                            Namabhas results in Prem. But practicing Namabhas slowly purifies one's heart so that the
                            sadhak is able to chant Shuddha naam and then Shuddha naam gives Prem. First the sadhak
                            enters and ascends through the stages of satsang, bhajan kriya, anartha nivritti, nishtha,
                            ruchi, aasakti, bhav and lastly, Prem. It is not possible by the hardwork of sadhak to
                            ascend through these stages, but it is harinaam that takes you through. You cannot
                            deliberate yourself from the stage of ruchi to the stage of aasakti. It is possible only by
                            the mercy of harinaam. Naam prabhu is not just a word, it is the same as naami, Krishna and
                            holds all the powers of Krishna. That is why even Namabhas purifies one's heart and gives
                            him the ability to chant Shuddha naam and gradually gives Prem. But yes, you have to beware
                            of Naam aparadhas.</p>

                        <p>This is the stage of pure, unadulterated chanting, characterized by full and uninterrupted
                            concentration on the holy name, completely free from all other extraneous thoughts (<em>anya
                                chinta rahit</em>). That is, without any other thought. If we give our full
                            concentration towards harinaam, we will get the fruits of chanting harinaam very quickly. At
                            this stage, the holy name is not merely heard; it is realized as being non-different from
                            the
                            Supreme Lord Himself. When we chant harinaam along with chintan (contemplating the pastimes
                            of Krishna and Radharani) it is called Shuddha naam. We have to think only of Radha Krishna
                            and no material subject. Such kind of chanting provides the fruits of chanting harinaam very
                            quickly. It is crucial to "chant Harinaam with utmost respect and love, and know that Naam
                            prabhu is not different from Nami (Krishna)". The text emphasizes that "it is harinaam that
                            takes you through" the stages of devotion, as "Naam prabhu is not just a word, it is the
                            same as naami, Krishna and holds all the powers of Krishna".</p>

            <p class="intro-text">
                For those who have found their Gurus, following their respective paths prescribed by their Gurus is the
                best path for them. Contemplating on the image of Guru, or the lotus feet of Guru, is "even more
                appreciated
                in our scriptures". Since Guru is not a human made up of flesh and blood, but the highest tatva who has
                been honored by even Ram and Krishna (by accepting Vashishtha rishi and Sandipani muni as Gurus,
                respectively), the attitude of resolute bhakti of Guru is said to be rare and more desirable than
                devotion to Krishna. "Kimparamadhikam Krishnebhaktih na guror adhikam na guror adhikam". But one must
                have firm faith that Guru is not a human being, Guru tatva is non different from Isvara tatva. While
                contemplating on the image of Guru, the image of Krishna will emerge from the image of Guru by the mercy
                of Gurudev. Indeed, one who has firm and unfailing faith in Guru is rare.

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #6c757d; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">The Role of Surrender in Chanting</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">
                To be surrendered, does the mind have to be pure? There is no waiting for purity. The Lord accepts a
                devotee the moment he surrenders. In the Gita, the Lord says, "Even if a person of the most evil
                conduct worships Me with undivided devotion, he should be regarded as righteous, for he has rightly
                resolved." The Lord continues, "He quickly becomes a righteous soul and attains lasting peace. O son of
                Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes!" If a person were already pure, there would be
                no need for the Lord to make such a bold promise. The promise is powerful precisely because the person
                was sinful, but by taking refuge, they are now protected. The moment a devotee, no matter how sinful,
                surrenders to the Lord, the Lord accepts him as His own. He doesn't wait for purity or good habits. Why?
                Because the Lord knows that the soul, on its own, does not have the power to cross over His divine
                energy, maya. He Himself says, "Mama maya duratyaya" (My divine energy is difficult to overcome).
                Therefore, there is no question of sin or virtue at the time of surrender. The only means of deliverance
                is the Lord's grace.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Sometimes, even after surrendering, maya can knock a devotee down. This is to make him stronger. It is a
                practical experience. The Lord makes him stumble to teach him a lesson. The devotee then realizes, "Oh,
                I made this mistake. I must never do it again." It's not that after a little bit of bhajan, you become
                free from all obstacles. The path is long. Have you ever been to the Himalayas? When you are ascending a
                mountain, sometimes the path goes down. An onlooker might say, "You are going down, not up!" But the
                path is such that after going down 1000 steps, you will have to climb 2000 steps to continue your
                ascent. It may look like a fall, but it is progress. You might see a devotee and think, "Oh, he has
                fallen, he is caught in maya," but you don't understand. He has to learn some experience there. The Lord
                is making him stronger.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Some karmic reactions are very strong (durbar bhog) and must be endured. But smaller ones can be
                mitigated by the grace of the Guru and God. Pray. Every night before sleeping, present whatever small
                desires you have in your heart to the Lord. Pray sincerely, "Please remove this, remove this from my
                heart." I have seen this in my own practical experience‚ÄîHe removes it. He erases it. Pray with tears,
                with desperation: "Radharani, this wicked desire in my heart is a terrible obstacle to attaining Your
                lotus feet. Protect me, save me, remove it from within me!" It is not that these things cannot be
                erased.
                But the prayer must be from the heart, not just with words. He does not listen to what your lips are
                saying; He listens to your heart.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Esoteric Mood of a Practitioner: Radha Within, Krishna Without</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                According to the esoteric teachings of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, the internal mood of a
                practitioner is beautifully encapsulated in the phrase <strong>"Radha within, Krishna without."</strong>
                The external chanting of Krishna's name is performed with the primary intention of bringing pleasure to
                Srimati Radharani, who becomes overwhelmed with ecstatic joy upon hearing the name of Her beloved. This
                is the profound and confidential secret of the practice, where the ultimate goal is to please the divine
                pleasure potency of the Lord.
            </p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <p>People don't know our path of worship (<em>upasana</em>). We are very dear to Radharani, but others
                    don't understand our method. Our worship is that of a <em>Radha-snehika</em>‚Äîone who is affectionate
                    to Radha, like Her closest handmaidens (<em>manjaris</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <p class="intro-text">
                There are five types of <em>sakhis</em> (friends of Radha): <em>sakhi</em>, <em>priya-sakhi</em>,
                <em>priya-narma-sakhi</em>, <em>prana-sakhi</em>, and <em>nitya-sakhi</em>. The <em>manjaris</em> are
                <em>nitya-sakhis</em>. They are always with Radharani. Her happiness is their life, their everything,
                their all-in-all. Their senses are dedicated to Her pleasure.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text">
                This spiritual form of a <em>manjari</em> is bestowed only by Radharani's grace. It cannot be achieved
                through one's own efforts or austerities. Only those upon whom Radharani bestows this mercy can attain
                that form. A <em>manjari</em> is like a spark (<em>sphuran</em>) from Radharani's own being. She is a
                miniature, unmanifested form of Radha. The only difference is the physical body (<em>deho bheda
                    matra</em>); in essence, she is non-different from Radharani. She knows nothing but Radha.
            </p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <p><em>Mor praneshwari Radha, Vrindavaneshwari, taar prananath boli bhoji Giridhari.</em><br>
                    (My life's queen is Radha, the Empress of Vrindavan. Knowing that Krishna is the Lord of Her life, I
                    worship Him.)</p>
            </div>

            <p class="intro-text">
                So, we worship Krishna because He is the Lord of Radharani's life. When Krishna is in an angry mood
                (<em>maan</em>), we do not let him enter the divine bower (<em>kunja</em>). Our service is to Radharani.
                That is why our internal reality is <strong>"Radha within, Krishna without."</strong> We
                chant "Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna" externally, but internally, our hearts are chanting "Radha, Radha,
                Radha." We know nothing else.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                The speaker explains the inner dynamic of pleasing Radha and Krishna:
                If you go directly to Radharani and chant, "Radhe, Radhe, Radhe," She does not feel as much joy and
                happiness. But if you go to Krishna and whisper "Radhe, Radhe" in His ear, He becomes completely
                ecstatic and thinks, "Who is this person who has made me hear Radha's name?"
                Similarly, if you go to Radharani and chant, "Krishna, Krishna, Krishna," She becomes overwhelmed with
                ecstatic love (pulokangi) and a great ocean of bliss erupts within Her. This is why we chant Krishna's
                name‚Äîto please Radharani.

                It is of paramount importance to have unwavering faith and steadfastness (nishtha) in one mantra. If you

            <p class="intro-text">
                The experience of bliss and spiritual connection in chanting may often seem to come and go. The answer
                is
                our continued association with the material world (vishaya). How can darkness and light exist in the
                same
                place? If there is light, darkness must go. Similarly, if you are attached to worldly sense objects and
                pleasures, how can you expect to constantly taste the bliss of the transcendental world? For the
                experience to be constant, one needs solitude and detachment from material entanglement. This is
                primarily attributed to our continued association with worldly sense objects and the pursuit of material
                pleasures (<em>vishaya</em>). Just as light and darkness cannot coexist in the same space, the
                transcendental bliss of Harinaam cannot be constantly and fully experienced while the heart remains
                attached to the material world. Therefore, a sincere practitioner must be ever-cautious of worldly
                attachments, which are described as "looters" that relentlessly pull the soul back into the painful
                cycle of birth, death, old age, and disease. For the experience to be constant, one needs solitude and
                detachment from material entanglement.

            <p>
                When I left home to do bhajan, I had no idea about initiation or a guru. I just knew I had to leave. For
                five years, I lived in solitude. After studying many scriptures, I concluded three things are essential:
                solitude (ekantata), chanting the holy name (Harinam Sankirtan), and the company of saints
                (sadhu-sanga). I had tried every path‚ÄîTantra, Yoga, Jnana‚Äîbut all scriptures concluded that in this age,
                Harinam is the only way.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I started chanting. I didn't know anything else. I would lock my door day and night and just chant
                Harinam. I can't describe the bliss I felt. Sometimes it felt as if I had drunk liquor. I would open my
                eyes and see nothing; I was in a state of complete intoxication. I had no initiation, no guru, but Radha
                Rani herself showed me many things practically. That is why I insist with so much force: whether you
                like it or not, do not leave the holy name. This is my practical experience, not something I just heard.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Transformative Power of Harinam: The Story of Hari Baba</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                The life of Hari Baba serves as a powerful testament to the transformative power of Harinam. From birth,
                Hari Baba was exceptionally intelligent. His father enrolled him in school, which he completed quickly.
                He
                was then sent to Lahore for medical studies, but his mind wasn't in it; his mind was set on bhajan. He
                understood that even if one gains wealth, fame, and all kinds of pleasures in this human body, life is
                wasted if one doesn't attain devotion to Hari. He had been deeply influenced by a great saint who taught
                him, "This body is perishable, this world is perishable. God has mercifully given you this human form,
                and through this body, attaining God is the only possibility." This thought completely detached his mind
                from the worldly cycle.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                His guru was Satchidananda Giri Maharaj, who was a follower of the formless Absolute (Nirguna Brahman).
                Hari Baba went to his guru's feet and said, "Baba, I don't like these studies. Please have mercy. Give
                me sannyasa (the vows of renunciation)." The guru explained, "True renunciation happens in the mind. A
                true sannyasi is one who is free from both desire and aversion, who has transcended all dualities. For
                such a person, wearing the ochre cloth is not necessary. When the mind detaches from all worldly objects
                and becomes singularly focused on the Lord's feet, that is true renunciation. Just as a fully ripened
                fruit falls from the tree on its own, when a seeker's inner dispassion (vairagya) becomes intense, the
                world of desire‚Äîfamily, home, business‚Äînaturally falls away. The world is not the house or shop; the
                world is desire (vasana). If you have desires for sense enjoyment, you are worldly. If you have the
                desire for God, you are a renunciate. It's that simple."
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Despite this counsel, Hari Baba left everything and went straight to Kashi (Varanasi). There, he took up
                the ochre robes of a renunciate himself. His austerities were intense. He would beg for his food
                (madhukari), and if he received more than two or four pieces of bread, he would wrap the excess in a
                cloth, bury it in the sand, and eat it the next day after washing it. In Kashi, he came into the company
                of other great saints like Oriya Baba and Premananda Baba, and his mind became intensely absorbed in
                bhajan. Yet, he felt something was missing. A seeker often grows disheartened, feeling that despite all
                efforts, the goal is not being reached. But one must never lose hope, for the Lord is all-merciful.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Hari Baba was a follower of the formless Brahman. He studied Vedanta in Wardha. The followers of this
                path do not believe in a personal God with form or qualities; they believe in an attributeless,
                unchanging, and unmanifest Absolute. All that we see is considered maya (illusion).
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                One day, a saint gave him a book titled Lord Gauranga, written by the great Bengali devotee Shishir
                Kumar Ghosh. After reading this book, his entire perspective shifted. His mind turned away from the
                worship of the formless Brahman and became completely attracted to the Saguna Savishesh‚Äîthe personal
                God with a divine name, form, and transcendental qualities like compassion and kindness, which are not
                of
                this material world.
            </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
                <p>"Atmaramascha munayo nirgrantha apy urukrame, kurvanti ahaitukim bhaktim ittham-bhuta-guno harih."
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Meaning: Even the self-satisfied sages, who are freed from the knot of matter and spirit, are
                irresistibly attracted to the transcendental qualities of Lord Hari and engage in His selfless,
                causeless
                devotion. This verse settled deep into his mind. The "knot" is the identification of the soul
                (consciousness) with the body (matter). Liberation from this knot is the ultimate goal of the path of
                knowledge. Yet, this verse says that even such liberated souls are attracted to the qualities of Lord
                Krishna and perform His devotion. After this, Hari Baba gave up the path of formless worship and became
                completely absorbed in Harinam Sankirtan (the congregational chanting of the holy names) in the mood of
                Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

            </h3>
            <p class="intro-text">
                He began to chant "Hare Krishna" wherever he went. Sometimes, he would be seen meditating, and at other
                times, he would be dancing and crying in ecstasy. Those on the path of knowledge couldn't understand.
                They would say, "Why does the soul cry? The soul is pure bliss." But these were not tears of worldly
                sorrow. When you unexpectedly meet a loved one after a long time, you cry out of overwhelming joy. These
                were tears of bliss (ananda-ashru), tears of divine love.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Hari Baba became mad with love for the holy name and went to extraordinary lengths to make others chant:

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #8b4513; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">The Danger of Worldly Affection</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">
                "How terrifying this is! This worldly "love" ensnares us and pulls us away from the lotus feet of
                Radharani, dragging us back towards the material world (samsara). We don't even realize what a terrible
                thing we are doing by engaging in this "love." We think, "Oh, these loving people are our
                well-wishers." But these very people, wrapping us in their affection, are leading us back into the
                world.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                We have attained this human body, which means we have reached the shore of the ocean of birth and death.
                This human body is a boat given to us to cross this ocean. But our so-called "loved ones," in whom we
                placed our trust, have ensnared us in affection and are pulling us back. We have no idea. We have become
                fools, seeing what is harmful as beneficial (anartha artha-darshina), and we place our trust in that
                which is dangerous.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                As the saying goes: <br>
                "Humko gairon ne nahi, yaaron ne loota." <br>
                (It was not strangers who looted me, but my own dear ones.)<br>
                Strangers wouldn't have had the power to do it. The one who is my enemy could not loot me. But my
                "friends," those I love, have looted me in such a way that I didn't even realize I was being robbed. I
                trusted them completely, and they kept looting the treasure of my spiritual progress. The grief I feel
                is this: if I had drowned in the middle of the deep ocean, I would n't have been so sad. My greatest
                sorrow is that I came all the way to the shore and drowned just a few steps away. This human body is a
                boat. You have been given a chance to cross the ocean of material existence. You have almost reached the
                shore, but right at the edge, you are made to drown. This is the greatest tragedy.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                One must live in fear‚Äînot fear of the world, but fear of being looted. Every moment, you must be
                cautious that no one pulls you back into this ocean of suffering. You have been given this one chance,
                this human body, to cross over. Your enemy is better for you; he criticizes you, defames you, and that
                makes a spiritual seeker vigilant. "Oh, people are slandering me, I must be careful so that no one can
                say such things." But your "loved ones"? They will lift you up only to slam you down. You must be saved
                from these dear ones. How will you be saved? That is for you and your karma to decide.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                There is one way to be saved: first, recognize them. When someone shows you affection, be wary. The most
                dangerous thing is if you love someone. If someone loves you, it is less dangerous; you might be able to
                escape. But if you start loving them, then you will surely be looted. Therefore, you must be careful not
                to love anyone in this way. See everyone as a form of God, but do not get attached to a particular
                person‚Äîbe it a wife, a son, a daughter, or anyone else where the mind gets stuck. This is dangerous.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                When you plant a sapling, you must protect it with a fence of thorns, because goats and cows will come
                and eat it. But when the tree grows large, you can tie an elephant to it, and nothing will happen.
                Similarly, in the beginning of your spiritual life, you must be saved from "dear ones." Don't love
                anyone
                in this way. If you do, know for certain that your boat will be sunk right at the shore by these very
                people.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #8b4513; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;">The Nature of Grace and Surrender</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">
                It is not an easy path of just eating and sleeping well and then going to the spiritual world. You have
                to endure hardships. Even great beings like Brahma are under the influence of maya; no one crosses it
                without the grace of God. True surrender (sharanagati) is the key.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                The grace of the Guru is always flowing, like the wind. It is not that there is more grace for one
                person and less for another. The difference is in your capacity to receive it (patrata). How much have
                you accepted?
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Consider this analogy: A father is walking with his two sons. One son is very small and can't walk, so
                the father carries him in his arms. The other son is walking alongside, holding his father's hand. A
                helicopter flies overhead. The son who was holding his father's hand gets excited, points up, "Look,
                Papa, look!" and, distracted, he stumbles on a stone and falls, getting badly hurt. The little child
                being carried in his father's arms also gets excited and points, "Papa, Papa!" but he does not fall. He
                is not hurt. Why? Are they not both the father's sons? Does the father love one more and the other
                less? No. The difference is that one son was walking by holding onto the father, while the other son was
                being held by the father. Because the father was holding him, there was no danger of him falling. The
                other son was relying on his own effort to hold on, and so he fell.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                This is the nature of surrender. One type of devotee is completely surrendered in every situation,
                trusting, "You do as You wish." The Lord Himself takes hold of such a devotee. The other type relies on
                his own efforts: "I have to do this chanting, this austerity, this and that." People like this often
                boast, "I am a devotee; what can maya do to me?" One who walks independently like this will fall.
            </p>

                **Translation:**
                "The scriptures say that the body is the medium for spiritual practice (*dharma sadhan*). Without a
                healthy body, no aspect of *bhajan* (devotional practice) or any spiritual discipline is possible.
                Therefore, keeping the body healthy is very important. In the present time, there is so much
                adulteration everywhere; every substance is so contaminated, even water has become contaminated. That is
                why children are born with diseases, carrying diseases from birth. Earlier, saints would perform a lot
                of *bhajan* just by eating dry bread. But now, despite consuming many vitamins, proteins, and various
                nutritional foods, people suffer from various ailments and unhealthiness. Why does this happen? The
                reason is contamination.

                They have brought a message of auspiciousness and grace for us, because divine grace is not visible, and
                God does not come directly to bestow grace. When God bestows grace, He comes in the form of a saint.
                Therefore, if a saint appears, understand that it is Radharani's grace, appearing in the form of a saint
                before you to bestow unconditional grace. So, the assembly of saints is an auspicious sign. If a saint
                is seen or met at home or anywhere, it should be understood that it is auspicious for us.

                One should practice a little attention for a short time daily, like Anulom Vilom (alternate nostril
                breathing), Kapalbhati (skull shining breath), and other such *asanas*. Practicing these *asanas* is
                very important for you. This is a very auspicious message for keeping the body healthy. Because if the
                body is not healthy, your *bhajan* life will be spoiled. It is necessary to keep the body healthy, and
                for health, the medicines available today have dangerous side effects. We see them as very beneficial.
                For example, if we have a headache, we take a painkiller. The headache subsides for some time. But is a
                painkiller a medicine? It is not a medicine, but its side effects are so bad that if you take it long
                term, your heart will be damaged in a short time, your kidneys will be damaged. You do not understand
                this, do you? Therefore, what is the beautiful solution? The beautiful solution is a very good
                indication: do not rely on medicine in the present time. This is an attempt to keep the body healthy
                through *pranayama*. In the morning, for just 15-20 minutes, we should practice this. This is not for
                everyone, but if you practice this, your body will remain disease-free. If the body is disease-free, you
                will have enthusiasm in every work, and you will find joy. Otherwise, in the future, the body will
                become unhealthy, and diseases will attack, causing you to wander around, keep taking medicines, lie in
                bed crying, and chant "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna" with great difficulty. Jai Radhe.
